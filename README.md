This is a [DipTrace](https://diptrace.com/) library for building guitar effects pedal PCBs.

I use this for my own PCBs and offer no support. You may find it useful so I share this as well. Feedback is always welcome.

It uses the [Font Monkey](https://www.fontmonkey.com/archive1.php) font "Milk Run" which is supplied in this repository and is [free for all use, commercial and otherwise](https://www.fontmonkey.com/faq.php).
